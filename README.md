The binary logic behind maths and computer science excites me because I can talk to them unambiguously and create tools to talk to the physical world and people as unequivocally as possible, depending on how precise yet perfect my tools are. I have good times when doing pure math (esp abstract algebra) and/or 420+69+53x; the appeal of the former is its absolute selflessness, that of the latter is its absolute selfishness. ^^
